# DL-Chess-Config-Detection
This project presents a learning based model for identifying the configuration of a given chess board
through image classification.

We have about 40,000 training images and 4,000 testing images. There
is also a CSV file which consists of the FEN of each image in the dataset. The dataset used can be
found here: AI Crowd Challenge .

A three layer Convolutional Neural Network is used as the model to predict the piece present in the cell.
